## Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
In this repo, I have incorporated the following OOP principles:

- **Inheritance:** demonstrate how classes can inherit properties and behaviors from other classes, promoting code reuse.
- **Encapsulation:** encapsulate data within classes and provide public interfaces to access and manipulate that data while maintaining data integrity.
- **Polymorphism:** showcase polymorphism by using method overriding and interfaces to achieve flexibility in class design.
